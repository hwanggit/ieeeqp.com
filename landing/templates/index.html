        <p class="lead" style="letter-spacing: 0.5px;">IEEE Quarterly Projects is your path to a great project
            experience. Over the course of 10 weeks (4 - 5 hours per week), you will be working with other students and
            an
            assigned mentor to create a truly AMAZING hardware/software product! Similar to an internship or job
            setting,
            there will be multiple opportunities to gain hands on experience that can be incredible milestones for your
            career.
            We also host bi-weekly work parties with exciting workshops like Arduino, Mobile Development, SolidWorks,
            and more!

        <h1 class="display-4">What is QP++?</h1><br>
        <p class="lead" style="letter-spacing: 0.5px;">QP++ is the more advanced version of regular Quarterly Projects
            competition. This program will run in parallel to QP, and we will expect more of its participants. Not only
            will QP++ teams receive more budget, but also they will be expected to create technically challenging and
            innovative products that can be sold on the market.

            <br><br>

            <br><br>

            QP++ will not be held this quarter. Instead, it will be merged with QP so that it is one big competition.</p>
